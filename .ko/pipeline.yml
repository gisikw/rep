# Build pipeline -- triage, implement, verify, review
#
# Triage is a decision node: it evaluates the ticket and either continues
# to implementation or signals fail/blocked/decompose via a JSON disposition.
#
# Implement and verify are action nodes: they just do work, no output parsing.
#
# Review is a decision node: it evaluates the implementation and either
# continues (succeed) or signals fail.
